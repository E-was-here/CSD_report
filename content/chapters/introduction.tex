\section{Context}
\label{section:requirements}

We have been tasked to design a numeric controller for a given system which has to meet some requirements. The system is 
called \textit{DC motor and brake} and it consists of two current controlled motors connected to a brake through a shaft.\\
Our objective is to send a command to the motors to ensure that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[$\bullet$] the shaft can reach any reasonable speed in less than half a second
    \item[$\bullet$] the shaft's speed is maintained as smooth as possible
    \item[$\bullet$] the system can reject a step disturbance as fast as possible
    \item[$\bullet$] the shaft's speed can follow a feasible speed reference of $4 Hz$ from any feasible speed
\end{enumerate}

In addition to this, we could implement a strategy to reject various brake disturbances profile and magnitude, while 
maintaining the speed variations as smooth as possible.

\section{Plant description}

As explained in the introduction, the plant consists of two motors and one brake acting on the same shaft. There are 
three sensors available: one speed sensor and two position sensors.
