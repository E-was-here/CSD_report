Complete section 1.3 (doing some experiments for it).
    simply adapting "Acquisition.m"
    (~ 30 minutes of preparation + ~1h in the lab)

Write PI report
    (~ 1h30 outside of the lab)

4 Hz Sine following (study + report + implementation + tests)
    - study ~ 30 minutes
    - report ~ 1h
    - implementation ~ 30 minutes
    - tests ~ 30 minutes

Implementation of motor 2 controller
    (~ 30 minutes)
    note this will require the sine following step to be done
